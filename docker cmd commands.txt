-> docker stop 7a6a32ababba			// 7a6a32ababba = CONTAINER ID
						// Stop the container with 7a6a32ababba CONTAINER ID

-> docker run -it -p 3000:3000 supercontainer	
                       |    |---> the port of host where the containere will run.
		       |--------> the port of container where the app will run.

-> docker-compose run smart-brain-api  		// "smart-brain-api" = name of the service that I want to run.
